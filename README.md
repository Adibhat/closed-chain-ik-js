# Closed Chain Inverse Kinematics

An inverse kinematics solver that supports closed chains and dynamic reconfiguration based on damped least squares error minimization techniques. Inspired in part by [Marty Vona's MSim research work](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/gpc/MSim/MSim-info.html) and using techniques outlined in this [2009 paper by Samuel Buss](https://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/ikmethods/iksurvey.pdf). Developed with some aid and advice from Marty Vona.
